Descole Test Lines				
msg_descole_test1	Test dialogue that's just stolen voicelines from the Professor Layton games.	I <i>knew</i> you would be an asset in my battle against them!	Descole	
msg_descole_test2	^^^	What an ugly, little man you are!	Descole	
msg_descole_test3	^^^	Apparently, I made a pact with a small-minded dullard!	Descole	
msg_descole_test4	^^^	The puzzle is clearly flawed.	Descole	
msg_descole_test5_1	Test dialogue to make sure that multiple sentence voicelines work properly.	I have been waiting patiently for the perfect moment to make my grand entrance.	Descole	
msg_descole_test5_2	^^^	The final act belongs to <i>me!</i>	Descole	
msg_descole_test6	The neat thing is, this one doesn't actually exist. Its sole purpose is to trigger the voiceline not recorded voiceline.	Surprise, assholes! Turns out I was the Big Dog the whole time!	Descole	
msg_descole_test7_1	Descole's opening monalogue in Professor Layton and the Last Specter. Mostly just to test how flexible multiple voicelines are.	Long ago, in a lawless age,	Descole	
msg_descole_test7_2	^^^	a pack of bandits invaded a small village.	Descole	
msg_descole_test7_3	^^^	Amidst the chaos, a terrified young farm girl	Descole	
msg_descole_test7_4	^^^	played her flute to drown out the madness.	Descole	
msg_descole_test7_5	^^^	As the music spiraled high into the sky,	Descole	
msg_descole_test7_6	^^^	a giant specter appeared above her.	Descole	
msg_descole_test7_7	^^^	She begged the specter to destroy the bandits, and it swiftly obeyed.	Descole	
msg_descole_test7_8	^^^	The town was saved;	Descole	
msg_descole_test7_9	^^^	and the specter vanished just as quickly as it had appeared.	Descole	
msg_descole_test7_10	^^^	But the farm girl knew that in times of danger,	Descole	
msg_descole_test7_11	^^^	she needed only to play the flute,	Descole	
msg_descole_test7_12	^^^	and the specter would appear again.	Descole	
msg_descole_test7_13	^^^			
msg_descole_test7_14	^^^	<i>[Book shuts]</i>		
msg_descole_test7_15	^^^	A quaint tale, wouldn't you say?	Descole	
msg_descole_test7_16	^^^	I think the time has come	Descole	
msg_descole_test7_17	^^^	for us to pen the next chapter...	Descole

msg_marb_opening_11	^^^	Ah!	Marb	
msg_marb_opening_12	^^^	It says here that not too long ago, 	Marb	
msg_marb_opening_13	^^^	the space station you're on now, the S.S. Burya, 	Marb	
msg_marb_opening_14	^^^	called out for help.	Marb	
msg_marb_opening_15	^^^	Apparently, something broke into the ship and killed everyone on board.	Marb	
msg_marb_opening_16	^^^	Don't worry though, you're not in any danger!	Marb	
msg_marb_opening_17	^^^	I'm not picking up any life signals other than you,	Marb	
msg_marb_opening_18	^^^	so whatever it was, it's gone now.	Marb

msg_marb_opening_24	^^^	(Hope that worked...)	Marb	
msg_marb_opening_25	^^^	A map of the ship should've appeared on your HUD just now.	Marb	
msg_marb_opening_26	^^^	So just bring power to each of the rooms,	Marb	
msg_marb_opening_27	^^^	and that'll activate, uh, the main engines!	Marb	
msg_marb_opening_28	^^^	And, once the engine's on, uh,	Marb	
msg_marb_opening_29	^^^	you can get out and get your paycheck!	Marb

msg_marb_opening_31	^^^	Good luck!	Marb

msg_marb_explain_cleanup_1	Plays when the player enters the first node for the first time. Explains how the cleanup system works.	Oh yeah, one more thing.	Marb	
msg_marb_explain_cleanup_2	^^^	Since you're here, the higher-ups figured	Marb	
msg_marb_explain_cleanup_3	^^^	you might as well clean the place up.	Marb	
msg_marb_explain_cleanup_4	^^^	In each room you enter, 	Marb	
msg_marb_explain_cleanup_5	^^^	you should see everything that has to be done	Marb	
msg_marb_explain_cleanup_6	^^^	in order to make the place presentable for rehabilitation.	Marb	
msg_marb_explain_cleanup_7	^^^	That's why you have those cleaning supplies on you.	Marb	
msg_marb_explain_cleanup_8	^^^			
msg_marb_explain_cleanup_9	^^^	In case you were wondering.	Marb	
msg_marb_explain_cleanup_10	^^^			
msg_marb_explain_cleanup_11	^^^	I-It's not like you're getting nothing for cleaning up or anything!	Marb	
msg_marb_explain_cleanup_12	^^^	The more you clean up, the more I can add to your paycheck!	Marb	
msg_marb_explain_cleanup_13	^^^	So there's, uh, that.	Marb	
msg_marb_explain_cleanup_14	^^^	A-And you don't have to clean up or anything if you don't want to!	Marb	
msg_marb_explain_cleanup_15	^^^	Th-They just thought it'd be efficient.	Marb	
msg_marb_explain_cleanup_16	^^^			
msg_marb_explain_cleanup_17	^^^	(Man, not being able to hear the person I'm talking to <i>really</i> sucks.)	Marb
