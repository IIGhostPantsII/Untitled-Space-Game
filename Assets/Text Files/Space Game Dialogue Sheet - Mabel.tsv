Descole Test Lines			
msg_descole_test1	Test dialogue that's just stolen voicelines from the Professor Layton games.	I <i>knew</i> you would be an asset in my battle against them!	Descole
msg_descole_test2	^^^	What an ugly, little man you are!	Descole
msg_descole_test3	^^^	Apparently, I made a pact with a small-minded dullard!	Descole
msg_descole_test4	^^^	The puzzle is clearly flawed.	Descole
msg_descole_test5_1	Test dialogue to make sure that multiple sentence voicelines work properly.	I have been waiting patiently for the perfect moment to make my grand entrance.	Descole
msg_descole_test5_2	^^^	The final act belongs to <i>me!</i>	Descole
msg_descole_test6	The neat thing is, this one doesn't actually exist. Its sole purpose is to trigger the voiceline not recorded voiceline.	Surprise, assholes! Turns out I was the Big Dog the whole time!	Descole
msg_descole_test7_1	Descole's opening monalogue in Professor Layton and the Last Specter. Mostly just to test how flexible multiple voicelines are.	Long ago, in a lawless age,	Descole

msg_descole_test7_6	^^^	a giant specter appeared above her.	Descole
msg_descole_test7_7	^^^	She begged the specter to destroy the bandits, and it swiftly obeyed.	Descole
msg_descole_test7_8	^^^	The town was saved;	Descole
msg_descole_test7_9	^^^	and the specter vanished just as quickly as it had appeared.	Descole
msg_descole_test7_10	^^^	But the farm girl knew that in times of danger,	Descole
msg_descole_test7_11	^^^	she needed only to play the flute,	Descole
msg_descole_test7_12	^^^	and the specter would appear again.	Descole
msg_descole_test7_13	^^^		
msg_descole_test7_14	^^^	<i>[Book shuts]</i>	
msg_descole_test7_15	^^^	A quaint tale, wouldn't you say?	Descole
msg_descole_test7_16	^^^	I think the time has come	Descole
msg_descole_test7_17	^^^	for us to pen the next chapter...	Descole
