In-Game Name	Description/Context	Dialogue
err_fake_voiceline	Debug dialogue that plays when the game tries to load a voiceline that doesn't exist in this document.	Sorry, the voiceline you tried to play doesn't actually exist.
err_not_recorded	Debug dialogue that plays when the voiceline exists in this document, but hasn't actually been recorded yet.	This voiceline hasn't been recorded yet.
msg_descole_test1	Test dialogue that's just stolen voicelines from the Professor Layton games.	I <i>knew</i> you would be an asset in my battle against them!
msg_descole_test2	^^^	What an ugly, little man you are!
msg_descole_test3	^^^	Apparently, I made a pact with a small-minded dullard!
msg_descole_test4	^^^	The puzzle is clearly flawed.
msg_descole_test5_1	Test dialogue to make sure that multiple sentence voicelines work properly.	I have been waiting patiently for the perfect moment to make my grand entrance.
msg_descole_test5_2	^^^	The final act belongs to <i>me!</i>
msg_descole_test6	The neat thing is, this one doesn't actually exist. Its sole purpose is to trigger the voiceline not recorded voiceline.	Surprise, assholes! Turns out <i>I</i> was the Big Dog the whole time!
